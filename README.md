# Client-Information-Management
This PHP script retrieves client data from a MySQL database and presents it in an HTML table. Client details such as ID, CIN, name, surname, age with color-coding, email, and password are displayed. Each row features a button to delete the respective client entry, redirecting to a deletion script.
